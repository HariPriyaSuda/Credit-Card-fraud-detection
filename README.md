# Credit-Card-fraud-detection
 • Focused on developing a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning algorithms, specifically K-Nearest
 Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes.                                                                                                                                          • Aimed to leverage machine learning techniques to accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions amidst a vast
 variety of legitimate transactions across different regions and currencies.                                                                                             • Contributed to enhanced security and trust in financial transactions.
